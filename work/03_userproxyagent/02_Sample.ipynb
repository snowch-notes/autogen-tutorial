    "\n",
    "This section provides an overview of the application code base in the `work/03_userproxyagent` directory, focusing on the files `app_team.py` and `app_team.html`. Special emphasis is placed on the role of the `UserProxyAgent` within the application.\n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The application is a FastAPI-based chat server that hosts a team of agents interacting in a round-robin fashion. The team consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AssistantAgent**: A helpful assistant agent.\n",
    "- **Yoda**: A variant of the assistant agent that repeats messages in the tone of Yoda.\n",
    "- **UserProxyAgent**: A proxy agent that represents the user, facilitating asynchronous user input via WebSocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "The front-end interface (`app_team.html`) connects to the backend WebSocket endpoint to send user messages and receive agent responses, enabling real-time chat interaction.\n",

    "\n",
    "### app_team.py\n",
    "\n",
    "**FastAPI Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The FastAPI app serves the chat interface HTML (`app_team.html`) at the root endpoint (`/`).\n",
    "- CORS middleware is configured to allow all origins, methods, and headers.\n",
    "- Static files are served from the current directory under the `/static` path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team Setup (`get_team` function)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loads model configuration from `model_config.yaml`.\n",
    "- Instantiates a `ChatCompletionClient` with the loaded config and environment API key.\n",
    "- Creates three agents:\n",
    "  - `AssistantAgent` named `\"assistant\"` with a system message defining its role.\n",
    "  - `AssistantAgent` named `\"yoda\"` with a system message to mimic Yoda's tone.\n",
    "  - `UserProxyAgent` named `\"user\"` which uses a provided asynchronous input function to receive user input.\n",
    "- These agents are combined into a `RoundRobinGroupChat` team.\n",
    "- The team state is loaded from `team_state.json` if it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**UserProxyAgent Role**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `UserProxyAgent` acts as a proxy for the human user within the team.\n",
    "- It is instantiated with an asynchronous input function (`input_func`) that is called whenever the agent requires user input.\n",
    "- This input function is implemented to asynchronously wait for messages from the WebSocket message queue.\n",
    "- This design allows the team to request user input asynchronously during the chat flow, enabling interactive conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**WebSocket Chat Endpoint (`/ws/chat`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accepts WebSocket connections from clients.\n",
    "- Maintains an asynchronous queue (`message_queue`) to hold incoming user messages.\n",
    "- Defines an internal `_user_input` async function that the `UserProxyAgent` uses to get user input by awaiting messages from the queue.\n",
    "- Listens for incoming WebSocket messages, validates them as `TextMessage` objects, and enqueues them.\n",
    "- Runs the team chat logic in a streaming fashion, sending agent messages back to the client over the WebSocket.\n",
    "- Saves team state and chat history to JSON files after each interaction.\n",
    "- Handles disconnections and errors gracefully, sending error messages to the client as needed.\n",

    "**Front-End Chat Interface**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A simple HTML page with a chat container displaying messages and an input box with a send button.\n",
    "- Connects to the backend WebSocket endpoint at `ws://localhost:8002/ws/chat`.\n",
    "- Sends user messages to the WebSocket when the send button is clicked or Enter is pressed.\n",
    "- Displays incoming messages from the WebSocket, differentiating between user, assistant, system, and error messages.\n",
    "- Handles special message types like `UserInputRequestedEvent` to re-enable the input box when the backend requests user input.\n",
    "- Loads chat history from the backend on page load to display previous messages.\n",

    "### Summary: UserProxyAgent's Role\n",
    "\n",
    "The `UserProxyAgent` serves as the bridge between the human user and the agent team. It enables the team to request and receive user input asynchronously during the conversation. This is achieved by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Passing an asynchronous input function to the `UserProxyAgent` that awaits messages from the WebSocket message queue.\n",
    "- The WebSocket endpoint receives user messages from the front-end and enqueues them for consumption by the `UserProxyAgent`.\n",
    "- This design allows the team to operate in a round-robin manner, with the `UserProxyAgent` seamlessly integrating human input into the agent conversation flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture enables interactive, real-time chat experiences where AI agents and the user collaborate in a conversational team.\n"
